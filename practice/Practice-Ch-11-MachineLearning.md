### Q11.3

> 🟡 L2-理解 | 🎤🎤 中频面试
An oil drilling platform operates in a remote location with satellite internet that is slow and frequently disconnected. The platform generates video feeds that need ML-based object detection for safety monitoring. The ML model must run locally and only send alerts (not full video) when connectivity is available.

Which combination of services should be used?

- A. SageMaker to train the model + IoT Greengrass to run inference locally on a Snowball Edge device
- B. SageMaker + Lambda@Edge at the nearest CloudFront edge location
- C. SageMaker real-time endpoint accessed over the satellite connection
- D. Monitron sensors placed on cameras for vibration-based detection

### Q11.4

> 🟡 L2-理解 | 🎤🎤 中频面试
A research team wants to train a custom computer vision model using 100,000 labeled images stored in S3. The team needs managed infrastructure for distributed training with GPU instances. After training, the model must be deployed as a real-time API endpoint with auto-scaling.

Which service provides the complete ML platform for this workflow?

- A. Amazon EC2 GPU instances + custom training scripts + Elastic Load Balancing
- B. Amazon SageMaker (Training Jobs + Model Hosting with auto-scaling)
- C. AWS Lambda with container images for both training and inference
- D. Amazon EMR with Spark MLlib for training + API Gateway for inference

# Part B �?Answers & Explanations

> ⚠️ **STOP HERE.** Complete all questions in Part A before reading below.

## 🟢 Knowledge Check �?Answers

### A11.1
**Correct: A** �?SageMaker + IoT Greengrass.

**Why**: SageMaker trains the model in the cloud. SageMaker Neo can optimize the model for edge hardware. IoT Greengrass deploys the model to edge devices and runs inference locally �?no cloud round-trip needed. Greengrass devices continue operating even when offline, syncing results when connectivity returns.

**📖 Textbook ref**: §11 �?SageMaker, "Deploy trained models to IoT Greengrass devices for edge inference"

---

### A11.2
**Correct: B** �?Amazon Monitron.

**Why**: Monitron is a purpose-built, end-to-end predictive maintenance system. It includes pre-calibrated sensors (vibration + temperature), a gateway device, and cloud service with pre-trained ML models for rotating equipment. No ML expertise required �?install sensors, connect gateway, receive alerts. It ships with models specifically trained for motors, pumps, and fans.

**📖 Textbook ref**: §11 �?Monitron, "Purpose-Built: Ships with pre-trained models for rotating equipment"

---

## 🟡 Scenario Analysis �?Answers

### A11.3
**Correct: A** �?SageMaker training + IoT Greengrass local inference on Snowball Edge.

**Why**: SageMaker trains the object detection model. Snowball Edge provides local compute (EC2 + Lambda) in the disconnected remote environment. IoT Greengrass runs on Snowball Edge and manages the ML model deployment and inference. Video is processed locally �?only alert metadata is transmitted when satellite is available. This is the edge ML pattern for disconnected environments.

**📖 Textbook ref**: §11 �?SageMaker, "Offline Inference: Snowball Edge for ML"; §13 �?Snowball Edge, "Disconnected Operation"

---

### A11.4
**Correct: B** �?Amazon SageMaker (Training Jobs + Model Hosting).

**Why**: SageMaker provides the complete ML platform: (1) Training Jobs with managed GPU instances (choose instance type, distributed training across multiple instances), (2) automatic hyperparameter tuning, (3) Model Registry for versioning, (4) Real-time endpoints with auto-scaling for inference. Everything is managed �?no infrastructure to set up beyond choosing instance types.

**📖 Textbook ref**: §11 �?SageMaker, "Fully managed ML platform"

---

## 🔴 Similar Service Comparison �?Answers

### A11.5
**Correct: A** �?Monitron for A; SageMaker for B.

**Why**: Monitron is turnkey �?pre-trained models, purpose-built sensors, no ML team needed. Perfect for generic rotating equipment monitoring. SageMaker is a flexible ML platform for custom models �?the data science team can build, train, and deploy their custom computer vision model. The key distinction: turnkey (Monitron) vs. custom (SageMaker).

**📖 Textbook ref**: §11 �?Monitron vs SageMaker: "No ML Expertise Required" vs "ML knowledge needed"
